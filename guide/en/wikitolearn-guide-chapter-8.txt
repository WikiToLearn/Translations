If you already have some content written with LaTeX you can upload it to WikiToLearn.

== Import content ==
If you have a course written in LaTeX and you want it to be imported you can send a mail to latex@wikitolearn.org.
The importing team will get in touch with you and upload the course under your user namespace.

== Convert content ==
We have developed a set of useful tools to convert Latex material into wikitext,
the markup WikiToLearn uses to write content pages.
The main tool is called TeXLa.

TeXLa is a LaTeX parser written in python. We use it to import courses and lectures
written by students, professors, techs, etc.

It's open source and you can find the code on [https://github.com/WikiToLearn/texla Github]!

There are a couple of different ways you can use TeXLa: the web client or the native python script.

=== Web client ===
If you want to use TeXLa without installing anything, visit https://texla.wikitolearn.org/.

You can write LaTeX content in the text area or upload a <code>.tex</code> file.
The website will convert your latex into a WikiToLearn ready-to-paste content.

You can just enter some text in latex syntax
(without worrying about latex preamble)
or you can even use latex macros and environments
(in this case the \begin{document} is necessary).

=== Python script ===

You can also choose to use the native python script to convert your files.
All the documentation on the configuration and installation is written [https://github.com/WikiToLearn/texla/blob/master/README.mdown WikiToLearn's Github].

=== Further documentation ===

A more detailed documentation on how to use TeXLa can be found here: http://meta.wikitolearn.org/Texla

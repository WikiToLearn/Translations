Books are grouped collections of sections that can be easily downloaded as pdf for offline reading.
Books allow you to create a personalized collection of sections from different chapters or even different courses.
In that way, you make your own book ready for being printed.

== Create a book ==
To create a book, click on the advanced feature button on the right.
A set of tools will show up.
Click on the first book and start the book creator.
Navigate to the desired section and click on "Add this page to your book" link.
With the book creator tool you can add pages or take a look to your book.
If you need more help on how to use the tool, there is a "Help" link on the top right corner of the box.
Otherwise you can read here.

Being a student you have probably already taken some notes. Let's start sharing them on WikiToLearn!

Thanks to the collaboration of other contributors like you, as well as the review of experts, we can together achieve higher quality material.

Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

== Step 1: Getting started ==
As a first step, we advise you to read the '''[[Manual|Manual]]'''. We can then get started by sharing your notes:
# Search for the related course: if it does not exist yet, '''[[Manual/Core concepts: Course|create it]]'''.
# You can '''[[Manual/Core_concepts:_Chapter|add new chapters]]''' inside the course, if it does not exist yet.
# It is possible to create concurrent versions of existing chapters, but we try to avoid to duplicate material.

Notes, written in Word, can be simply copy pasted. For LaTeX notes you can use our '''[https://texla.wikitolearn.org LaTex to Wiki Converter]'''! (read more on the '''[[Manual/Importing from LaTeX|LaTex guide]]''')

Contact us at '''[https://chat.wikitolearn.org/channel/importing #importing]''' on the WikiToLearn chat if you have any problems.

Otherwise, you could also start from the existing material and review it.

== Step 2: Engage your group ==
If you donâ€™t want to work alone, do it with your friends! You could split the work and set up a schedule for writing and reviewing the notes. With less than a couple of hours per week of work, you can get clearly arranged notes of your courses, even better than a usual textbook, with which you will be able to optimise your study.

== Step 3: Spread the word ==
Another way to contribute is to spread the word about WikiToLearn! Show friends and other students what WikiToLearn is, how WikiToLearn works and tell them how it helped you.

You could also introduce the project to your professors and tell them about the possibility to proofread your notes in order to get some feedback on how effective their lessons were.

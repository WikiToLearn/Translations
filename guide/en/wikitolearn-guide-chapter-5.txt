VisualEditor is the main tool you can use to create and edit pages on WikiToLearn.
Using VisualEditor is very easy!
If you already have some experience in any kind of text editing software you will have no problem in understanding how VisualEditor works.

== Basic Usage ==

=== Activating VisualEditor ===
When creating a new section, VisualEditor should be enabled by default: a toolbar should appear at the top of the page.

If you want to edit an existing page, just press the <code>Edit</code> button at the top of the page and watch VisualEditor load: after a few seconds it should be ready to use.


=== Editing ===
VisualEditor has more or less the same features and functions of any other word processor software, like bold, italics, ordered lists and so on.

=== Advanced editing ===

==== Insert media ====
To insert media in the text,  just click the <code>Insert</code> option in the VisualEditor toolbar and select <code>Media</code>: you can either upload new files using the <code>Upload</code> tab or <code>Search</code> for existing media both on WikiToLearn or Wikimedia Commons.

==== Insert formulas ====
To insert mathematical formulas in the text, just click the <code>Insert</code> option in the VisualEditor toolbar and select <code>Formula</code>: this will open up the Formula Editor window which will allow you to write math formulas easily.

==== Insert templates ====
Templates are used to add recurring messages to pages in a consistent way.
They are often used in mathematics sections when you want to write a definition, theorem, lemma, corollary etc.
They can be inserted within any section of the course.

To insert templates you can use the <code>Insert->Template</code> function. To know more about the Templates and have examples on the ones to use please check out [[Manual/Using templates|the Templates page]].

Course is a collection of pages with a well defined tree structure. Every course on WikiToLearn has a unique name. You can create a private course under your namespace or a public/collaborative course where everyone can contribute.

== Create a course ==
The first thing to do to create a course is going to the right department. For example, if you are writing a <code>Quantum Physics</code> course then you need to go to the physics department located at http://en.wikitolearn.org/Physics

(TODO: insert a template button on departments to create a course)

When you click on the "Create course" button a form shows up.

You can choose to make the course public or private. A public course is located under the related department, while a private course is located under the user namespace.

It is strongly recommended to create a private course and publish it once completed.

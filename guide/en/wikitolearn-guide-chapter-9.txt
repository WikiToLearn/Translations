If you have some material written in <code>.doc</code> format, you can convert it to WikiToLearn.

Conversion is a little tricky. You can simply copy and paste text into the Visual editor, but it does not work for formulas, etc. Take a look [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:WordToWiki#VisualEditor here] to find other possibilities on how to import content.

If you have some material written in <code>.doc</code> format, you can convert it to WikiToLearn.

Conversion is a little tricky, but usually copy and pasting to the Visual editor works. You can also take a look [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:WordToWiki#VisualEditor here, which has listed some ways] to do that.

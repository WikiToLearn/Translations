WikiToLearn is a portal that aims to create free collaborative and readily accessible textbooks. Our philosophy can be summarised as "''Knowledge only grows if shared''".

== Conventions ==
In order to write consistent book, WikiToLearn makes a large use of the hierarchy model

=== Department ===
It's the biggest container in WikiToLearn. It's a collection of topics, courses and books  belonging to the same area. Departments are listed on the main page.

=== Topic ===
Topics are children of a department and contains different courses related to the same argument. Topics are created because a course may change in its structure and content from university to university, even though the course name is the same. Topics act like a container of these different related courses. For example, <code>Calculus</code>may be a topic and <code>Calculus for physics</code>, <code>Calculus for computer science</code>may be a course. (add image here)

=== Course ===
Course is the most important unit of WikiToLearn. Courses are a collection of pages structured like a university course. Every course has a prefix <code>Course:</code>followed by the course name in its url. (add image here)

=== Section ===
Sections are immediately children of a course. They are collections of single pages also known as chapters and are displayed as heading titles. (Add image here)

=== Chapter ===
Chapters are the basic unit of an entire course. Basically, they're a single page with their own content.

== Namespaces ==
Namespaces are a mechanism to group pages. You can see the namespace by looking at the url: if it has a <code>word:something_else</code>then word is the namespace. In WikiTolearn there are two main namspaces, the User and the Course.

=== User namespace ===
When you register on WikiToLearn a page called <code>User:your_username</code>is created. The User namespace is your personal place where you can write your own courses and content without worring about making mistakes.

=== Course namespace ===
